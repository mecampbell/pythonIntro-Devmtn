# Loop through all the data and print out the total for each invoice 
# (Note: this data is not provided by the csv, you will need to calculate it. 
# Also, keep in mind the data from the csv comes back as a string, you will need to convert it to a float.
# Research how to do this.).

# Challenge: Do some research and see if you can limit your floats to never exceed to characters
# after the decimal point.

# Going Further
# Explore the graphing tools covered in todayâ€™s lecture. 
# See if you can implement one of them to display the total income of
# chocolate cupcakes vs vanilla cupcakes vs strawberry cupcakes.
